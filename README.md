### For True Depth Camera User
This application captures RGB and Depth images from the TrueDepth Camera of your iOS device.

Now, capturing and streaming are initiated.

## 2. Viewer Applications (Receiver Side)
Here's how to operate the viewer applications:

1. Install the application on your device.
   - ARCore/Nreal/Quest: Install the compatible **.apk**.
   - LookingGlass: Unzip **LKG_WRTC_HoloTuberKit.zip**.
   - iOS: Download the app from AppStore.
2. Launch the application.
   - Android/iOS/Nreal/Quest: Start HoloTuber(WRTC).
   - LookingGlass: Run HoloTuberKit.exe.
3. Enter the same Streaming ID that user of sender side entered in the capture app.
4. Tap the **Connect** button or hit the **Enter Key** of the virtual keyboard.

Follow these steps to utilize the viewer applications effectively.

# Known Issue
### 1.Connection Error  
In highly secure network environments, it may not be possible to obtain the device's IP address, which can prevent point cloud streaming. In such cases, please use tethering from a smartphone or other means to stream.  

### 2.FireWallSetting for LookingGlass App  
When running the Windows version of the Looking Glass app for the first time, a dialog will appear asking whether to allow the app to connect to the network.  
If this appears within the Looking Glass display, the text may be very difficult to read, but please **CLICK the BUTTON on the LEFT**ã€€to allow the connection.  
If you accidentally click the button on the right, please remove "holotuberkit.exe" from the list of firewall apps.
